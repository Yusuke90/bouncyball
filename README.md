# bouncyball
simulation of bouncing balls 
-> has a toggle between earth gravity, space gravity(gravitation forces due to surrounding objects)
-> has a constant force called wind that blows the balls sideways the upper end pulls it towards the wind bar and the lower end pushes it away
-> size and mass can be changed but they change together 
-> the simulation values for g and G along with coeff of restitution has been modified 
-> on a personal note i would probably make the interface a bit more prettier
